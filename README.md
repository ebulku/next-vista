# Next Vista 
Next.js 15 Admin Dashboard with Prisma and shadcn/ui

This Admin Dashboard is built following the
[Next.js tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn) for Next.js 15 with added
integration of [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/). Additionally, this project
incorporates [shadcn/ui](https://shadcn.dev/) for reusable and beautifully
designed UI components. [Vercel Storage](https://vercel.com/docs/storage) is
used for storing images and files.

## Demo

You can try a live demo of this dashboard here:

## Overview

This application is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React
framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and more.
Prisma has been integrated to simplify data management and provide a strong
type-safe connection to the database.

## Technologies

- **Next.js**: Framework for creating performant and scalable React applications
  with a focus on server-rendering and static exports.
- **Prisma**: Used as the ORM for database management, providing a smooth way to
  interact with the database in a type-safe manner.
- **shadcn/ui**: Integrated for building elegant, reusable components with
  consistent styling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v15 or later
- `pnpm` package manager (you can use `npm` or `yarn` if preferred)
- A database supported by Prisma (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ebulku/next-vista.git
   cd next-vista
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Configure Prisma**:

   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill your database connection and other env variables.:

   ```plaintext
    POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL=
    POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING=

    # `openssl rand -base64 32`
    AUTH_SECRET=
    AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/auth
    AUTH_TRUST_HOST=http://localhost:3000

    # Vercel Blob Storage Auth
    # 'vercel_blob' or 'local' if you want to use local storage
    STORAGE="local"
    BLOB_STORE_HOSTNAME=
    BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=

    NEXT_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME="localhost"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT="development"
   ```

4. **Run Prisma migrations and seed initial data**:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   npx prisma db seed
   ```

5. **Generate Prisma client**:

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

6. **Start the Next.js development server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

### Project Structure

- `app/`: Contains the main pages for the Next.js application.
- `prisma/`: Contains Prisma schema and migration files.
- `components/`: Contains reusable components implemented with shadcn/ui.

### Usage

To develop or test the app locally, you can start the development server with:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The app should be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Prisma Integration

Prisma is used in this project to handle data interactions. Hereâ€™s a quick
overview of commands to manage the database with Prisma:

- **Run migrations**:

  ```bash
  npx prisma migrate dev
  ```

- **Generate Prisma client**:

  ```bash
  npx prisma generate
  ```

- **Open Prisma Studio** (a web-based interface for interacting with your
  database):
  ```bash
  npx prisma studio
  ```
